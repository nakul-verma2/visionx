# visionx
This project implements real-time object detection using YOLOv8 with OpenCV. It's built for detecting custom objects like fire extinguishers, toolboxes, and oxygen tanks using a webcam or video stream. The project includes scripts for training, evaluation, and inference on both test datasets and live feeds.
